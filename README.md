# GetFlixProject - Welcome in our :sparkles: :sparkles: streaming plateform :sparkles: :sparkles: ! 

## What is GetFlix?
GetFlix is a streaming site inspired by platforms such as NetFlix, with a catalog of movies which the users can filter in the search bar. The site includes also a space to comment on the content. Administrators have access to a database to manage the comments.

## Why GetFlix?
This project was build in the context of BeCode Web Development course. The main goal was to consolidate our skills of PHP and MySQL, as well as the ability to communicate and work in a team.

## Creation process of GetFlix
We had 10 days to complete the task. 
Our first step was to think about the design and content of our future site. We did a lot of research on the internet to acquire enough knowledge to start. 

The second step was to think about the deployment of the website. As instruction we had to use docker, MyPHPAdmin and MariaDB. We took a moment to get familiar with those technologies by registering and creating a first database. 

We splitted the tasks between us as following:
+ Ivan was the project manager and he was in charge of both the back-end and front-end development;
+ Sofian was in charge of the front-end development part;
+ Nicolas was in charge of the back-end development part;
+ Anne was in charge of the back-end development part; 

We had daily meetings to monitor the development of the project, indentify difficulties or redefines tasks.
